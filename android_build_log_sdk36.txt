Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 35, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle compiles against Android SDK 36
- image_picker_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- url_launcher_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\Users\Shani\Documents\GitHub\quiz app flutter\android\app\build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }
Font asset "Font-Awesome-7-Brands-Regular-400.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 199352 to 2224 bytes (98.9% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Font asset "CupertinoIcons.ttf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 257628 to 848 bytes (99.7% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 14156 bytes (99.1% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.

       1.  Dependency 'androidx.browser:browser:1.9.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 36 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled against android-35.

           Also, the maximum recommended compile SDK version for Android Gradle
           plugin 8.7.3 is 35.

           Recommended action: Update this project's version of the Android Gradle
           plugin to one that supports 36, then update this project to use
           compileSdk of at least 36.

           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
